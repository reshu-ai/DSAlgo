/*In C++, friend classes provide an alternative inheritance mechanism to derived
 classes. The main difference between classical inheritance and friend inheritance 
is that a friend class can access private members of the base class, which isn't 
the case for classical inheritance. In classical inheritance, a derived class can 
only access public and protected members of the base class.*/
