Let us take a look at a typical computer usage scenario to see how the different types of memory are used:

    After switching on the computer, it loads data from its read-only memory (ROM) and performs a power-on self-test (POST) to ensure that all major components are working properly. Additionally, the computer memory controller checks all of the memory addresses with a simple read/write operation to ensure that memory is functioning correctly.

    After performing the self-test, the computer loads the basic input/output system (BIOS) from ROM. The major task of the BIOS is to make the computer functional by providing basic information about such things as storage devices, boot sequence, security or auto device recognition capability.

    The process of activating a more complex system on a simple system is called "bootstrapping": It is a solution for the chicken-egg-problem of starting a software-driven system by itself using software. During bootstrapping, the computer loads the operating system (OS) from the hard drive into random access memory (RAM). RAM is considered "random access" because any memory cell can be accessed directly by intersecting the respective row and column in the matrix-like memory layout. For performance reasons, many parts of the OS are kept in RAM as long as the computer is powered on.

    When an application is started, it is loaded into RAM. However, several application components are only loaded into RAM on demand to preserve memory. Files that are opened during runtime are also loaded into RAM. When a file is saved, it is written to the specified storage device. After closing the application, it is deleted from RAM.
